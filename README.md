# Dijkstra Pathfinding

## Project Description

A comprehensive visualization and implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in Python. This project provides an intuitive way to understand how Dijkstra's algorithm works by offering both algorithmic implementation and visual representation of the pathfinding process.

## Key Features

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Implementation**: Efficient shortest path finding between nodes in a weighted graph
- **Interactive Visualization**: Visual representation of the algorithm's execution process
- **Python-Based**: Clean, readable implementation in Python
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for learning and understanding graph algorithms

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies (if any) listed in requirements.txt

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rahulkumar7189/dijkstra-pathfinding.git
   cd dijkstra-pathfinding
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the main script to start the pathfinding visualization:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to:
- Set start and end points
- Visualize the algorithm in action
- View the shortest path calculation

## How It Works

Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph by:
1. Starting from the source node
2. Exploring neighboring nodes
3. Calculating cumulative distances
4. Always choosing the node with the smallest tentative distance
5. Continuing until the destination is reached or all nodes are visited
